    /**
     * Julian Day field.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * This is an integer-based version of the Julian Day Number.
     * Julian Day is a well-known system that represents the count of whole days since day 0,
     * which is defined to be January 1, 4713 BCE in the Julian calendar, and -4713-11-24 Gregorian.
     * The field  has &quot;JulianDay&quot; as 'name', and 'DAYS' as 'baseUnit'.
     * The field always refers to the local date-time, ignoring the offset or zone.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * For date-times, 'JULIAN_DAY.getFrom()' assumes the same value from
     * midnight until just before the next midnight.
     * When 'JULIAN_DAY.adjustInto()' is applied to a date-time, the time of day portion remains unaltered.
     * 'JULIAN_DAY.adjustInto()' and 'JULIAN_DAY.getFrom()' only apply to {@code Temporal} objects that
     * can be converted into {@link ChronoField#EPOCH_DAY}.
     * An {@link UnsupportedTemporalTypeException} is thrown for any other type of object.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a Julian Day field.
     * In {@linkplain ResolverStyle#STRICT strict mode} and {@linkplain ResolverStyle#SMART smart mode}
     * the Julian Day value is validated against the range of valid values.
     * In {@linkplain ResolverStyle#LENIENT lenient mode} no validation occurs.
     *
     * &lt;h3&gt;Astronomical and Scientific Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
     * The standard astronomical definition uses a fraction to indicate the time-of-day,
     * thus 3.25 would represent the time 18:00, since days start at midday.
     * This implementation uses an integer and days starting at midnight.
     * The integer value for the Julian Day Number is the astronomical Julian Day value at midday
     * of the date in question.
     * This amounts to the astronomical Julian Day, rounded to an integer {@code JDN = floor(JD + 0.5)}.
