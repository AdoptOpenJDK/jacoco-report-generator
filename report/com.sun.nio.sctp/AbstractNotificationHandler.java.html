/**
 * A skeletal handler that consumes notifications and continues.
 *
 * &lt;P&gt; This class trivially implements the {@code handleNotification} methods to
 * return {@link HandlerResult#CONTINUE CONTINUE} so that all notifications are
 * consumed and the channel continues to try and receive a message.
 *
 * &lt;P&gt; It also provides overloaded versions of the {@code handleNotification}
 * methods, one for each of the required supported notification types, {@link
 * AssociationChangeNotification}, {@link PeerAddressChangeNotification},
 * {@link SendFailedNotification}, and {@link ShutdownNotification}. The
 * appropriate method will be invoked when the notification is received.
 *
 * @since 1.7
