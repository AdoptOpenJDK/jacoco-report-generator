/**
 * A class that represents an SCTP association.
 *
 * &lt;P&gt; An association exists between two SCTP endpoints. Each endpoint is
 * represented by a list of transport addresses through which that endpoint can
 * be reached and from which it will originate SCTP messages. The association
 * spans over all of the possible source/destination combinations which may be
 * generated from each endpoint's lists of addresses.
 *
 * &lt;P&gt; Associations are identified by their Association ID.
 * Association ID's are guaranteed to be unique for the lifetime of the
 * association. An association ID may be reused after the association has been
 * shutdown. An association ID is not unique across multiple SCTP channels.
 * An Association's local and remote addresses may change if the SCTP
 * implementation supports &lt;I&gt;Dynamic Address Reconfiguration&lt;/I&gt; as defined by
 * &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5061&quot;&gt;RFC5061&lt;/A&gt;, see the
 * {@code bindAddress} and {@code unbindAddress} methods of {@link SctpChannel},
 * {@link SctpServerChannel}, and {@link SctpMultiChannel}.
 *
 * &lt;P&gt; An {@code Association} is returned from an {@link
 * SctpChannel#association SctpChannel} or an {@link
 * SctpMultiChannel#associations SctpMultiChannel}, as well
 * as being given as a parameter to {@link NotificationHandler
 * NotificationHandler} methods.
