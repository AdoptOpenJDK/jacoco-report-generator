     * defined. Two of the levels effect {@link SctpChannel}, while
     * {@link SctpMultiChannel} is effected by all three levels.
     *
     * &lt;P&gt; This option takes an {@code Integer} value. It can be set to a value
     * of {@code 0}, {@code 1} or {@code 2}.
     *
     * &lt;P&gt; Setting the three levels provides the following receiver
     * interactions:
     *
     * &lt;P&gt; {@code level 0} - Prevents the interleaving of any messages. This
     * means that when a partial delivery begins, no other messages will be
     * received except the message being partially delivered. If another message
     * arrives on a different stream (or association) that could be delivered,
     * it will be blocked waiting for the user to read all of the partially
     * delivered message.
     *
     * &lt;P&gt; {@code level 1} - Allows interleaving of messages that are from
     * different associations. For {@code SctpChannel}, level 0 and
     * level 1 have the same meaning since an {@code SctpChannel} always
     * receives messages from the same association. Note that setting an {@code
     * SctpMultiChannel} to this level may cause multiple partial
     * delivers from different associations but for any given association, only
     * one message will be delivered until all parts of a message have been
     * delivered. This means that one large message, being read with an
     * association identification of &quot;X&quot;, will block other messages from
     * association &quot;X&quot; from being delivered.
     *
     * &lt;P&gt; {@code level 2} - Allows complete interleaving of messages. This
     * level requires that the sender carefully observe not only the peer
     * {@code Association} but also must pay careful attention to the stream
     * number. With this option enabled a partially delivered message may begin
     * being delivered for association &quot;X&quot; stream &quot;Y&quot; and the next subsequent
     * receive may return a message from association &quot;X&quot; stream &quot;Z&quot;. Note that
     * no other messages would be delivered for association &quot;X&quot; stream &quot;Y&quot;
     * until all of stream &quot;Y&quot;'s partially delivered message was read.
     * Note that this option effects both channel types.  Also note that
     * for an {@code SctpMultiChannel} not only may another streams
     * message from the same association be delivered from the next receive,
     * some other associations message may be delivered upon the next receive.
