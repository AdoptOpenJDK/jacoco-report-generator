/**
 * The abstract class {@code ContentHandler} is the superclass
 * of all classes that read an {@code Object} from a
 * {@code URLConnection}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An application does not generally call the
 * {@code getContent} method in this class directly. Instead, an
 * application calls the {@code getContent} method in class
 * {@code URL} or in {@code URLConnection}.
 * The application's content handler factory (an instance of a class that
 * implements the interface {@code ContentHandlerFactory} set
 * up by a call to {@code setContentHandler}) is
 * called with a {@code String} giving the MIME type of the
 * object being received on the socket. The factory returns an
 * instance of a subclass of {@code ContentHandler}, and its
 * {@code getContent} method is called to create the object.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If no content handler could be found, URLConnection will
 * look for a content handler in a user-defineable set of places.
 * By default it looks in sun.net.www.content, but users can define a
 * vertical-bar delimited set of class prefixes to search through in
 * addition by defining the java.content.handler.pkgs property.
 * The class name must be of the form:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *     {package-prefix}.{major}.{minor}
 * e.g.
 *     YoyoDyne.experimental.text.plain
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * If the loading of the content handler class would be performed by
 * a classloader that is outside of the delegation chain of the caller,
 * the JVM will need the RuntimePermission &quot;getClassLoader&quot;.
