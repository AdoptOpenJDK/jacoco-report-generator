/**
 * Class OrientationRequested is a printing attribute class, an enumeration,
 * that indicates the desired orientation for printed print-stream pages; it
 * does not describe the orientation of the client-supplied print-stream
 * pages.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * For some document formats (such as &lt;CODE&gt;&quot;application/postscript&quot;&lt;/CODE&gt;),
 * the desired orientation of the print-stream pages is specified within the
 * document data. This information is generated by a device driver prior to
 * the submission of the print job. Other document formats (such as
 * &lt;CODE&gt;&quot;text/plain&quot;&lt;/CODE&gt;) do not include the notion of desired orientation
 * within the document data. In the latter case it is possible for the printer
 * to bind the desired orientation to the document data after it has been
 * submitted. It is expected that a printer would only support the
 * OrientationRequested attribute for some document formats (e.g.,
 * &lt;CODE&gt;&quot;text/plain&quot;&lt;/CODE&gt; or &lt;CODE&gt;&quot;text/html&quot;&lt;/CODE&gt;) but not others (e.g.
 * &lt;CODE&gt;&quot;application/postscript&quot;&lt;/CODE&gt;). This is no different from any other
 * job template attribute, since a print job can always impose constraints
 * among the values of different job template attributes.
 *  However, a special mention
 * is made here since it is very likely that a printer will support the
 * OrientationRequested attribute for only a subset of the supported document
 * formats.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * &lt;B&gt;IPP Compatibility:&lt;/B&gt; The category name returned by
 * &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt; is the IPP attribute name.  The enumeration's
 * integer value is the IPP enum value.  The &lt;code&gt;toString()&lt;/code&gt; method
 * returns the IPP string representation of the attribute value.
 * &lt;P&gt;
