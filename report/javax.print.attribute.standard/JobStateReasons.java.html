/**
 * Class JobStateReasons is a printing attribute class, a set of enumeration
 * values, that provides additional information about the job's current state,
 * i.e., information that augments the value of the job's {@link JobState
 * JobState} attribute.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Instances of {@link JobStateReason JobStateReason} do not appear in a Print
 * Job's attribute set directly. Rather, a JobStateReasons attribute appears in
 * the Print Job's attribute set. The JobStateReasons attribute contains zero,
 * one, or more than one {@link JobStateReason JobStateReason} objects which
 * pertain to the Print Job's status. The printer adds a {@link JobStateReason
 * JobStateReason} object to the Print Job's JobStateReasons attribute when the
 * corresponding condition becomes true of the Print Job, and the printer
 * removes the {@link JobStateReason JobStateReason} object again when the
 * corresponding condition becomes false, regardless of whether the Print Job's
 * overall {@link JobState JobState} also changed.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Class JobStateReasons inherits its implementation from class {@link
 * java.util.HashSet java.util.HashSet}. Unlike most printing attributes which
 * are immutable once constructed, class JobStateReasons is designed to be
 * mutable; you can add {@link JobStateReason JobStateReason} objects to an
 * existing JobStateReasons object and remove them again. However, like class
 * {@link java.util.HashSet java.util.HashSet}, class JobStateReasons is not
 * multiple thread safe. If a JobStateReasons object will be used by multiple
 * threads, be sure to synchronize its operations (e.g., using a synchronized
 * set view obtained from class {@link java.util.Collections
 * java.util.Collections}).
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * &lt;B&gt;IPP Compatibility:&lt;/B&gt; The string value returned by each individual {@link
 * JobStateReason JobStateReason} object's &lt;CODE&gt;toString()&lt;/CODE&gt; method gives
 * the IPP keyword value. The category name returned by &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt;
 * gives the IPP attribute name.
