/**
 * Class PrinterStateReason is a printing attribute class, an enumeration,
 * that provides additional information about the printer's current state,
 * i.e., information that augments the value of the printer's
 * {@link PrinterState PrinterState} attribute.
 * Class PrinterStateReason defines standard printer
 * state reason values. A Print Service implementation only needs to report
 * those printer state reasons which are appropriate for the particular
 * implementation; it does not have to report every defined printer state
 * reason.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Instances of PrinterStateReason do not appear in a Print Service's
 * attribute set directly.
 * Rather, a {@link PrinterStateReasons PrinterStateReasons}
 * attribute appears in the Print Service's attribute set. The {@link
 * PrinterStateReasons PrinterStateReasons} attribute contains zero, one, or
 * more than one PrinterStateReason objects which pertain to the
 * Print Service's status, and each PrinterStateReason object is
 * associated with a {@link Severity Severity} level of REPORT (least severe),
 * WARNING, or ERROR (most severe). The printer adds a PrinterStateReason
 * object to the Print Service's
 * {@link PrinterStateReasons PrinterStateReasons} attribute when the
 * corresponding condition becomes true of the printer, and the printer
 * removes the PrinterStateReason object again when the corresponding
 * condition becomes false, regardless of whether the Print Service's overall
 * {@link PrinterState PrinterState} also changed.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * &lt;B&gt;IPP Compatibility:&lt;/B&gt;
 * The string values returned by each individual {@link PrinterStateReason} and
 * associated {@link Severity} object's &lt;CODE&gt;toString()&lt;/CODE&gt;
 * methods, concatenated together with a hyphen (&lt;CODE&gt;&quot;-&quot;&lt;/CODE&gt;) in
 * between, gives the IPP keyword value for a {@link PrinterStateReasons}.
 * The category name returned by &lt;CODE&gt;getName()&lt;/CODE&gt; gives the IPP
 * attribute name.
 * &lt;P&gt;
