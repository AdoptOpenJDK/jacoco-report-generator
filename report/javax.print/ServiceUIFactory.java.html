/**
 * Services may optionally provide UIs which allow different styles
 * of interaction in different roles.
 * One role may be end-user browsing and setting of print options.
 * Another role may be administering the print service.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Although the Print Service API does not presently provide standardised
 * support for administering a print service, monitoring of the print
 * service is possible and a UI may provide for private update mechanisms.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The basic design intent is to allow applications to lazily locate and
 * initialize services only when needed without any API dependencies
 * except in an environment in which they are used.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Swing UIs are preferred as they provide a more consistent {@literal L&amp;F}
 * and can support accessibility APIs.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Example usage:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *  ServiceUIFactory factory = printService.getServiceUIFactory();
 *  if (factory != null) {
 *      JComponent swingui = (JComponent)factory.getUI(
 *                                         ServiceUIFactory.MAIN_UIROLE,
 *                                         ServiceUIFactory.JCOMPONENT_UI);
 *      if (swingui != null) {
 *          tabbedpane.add(&quot;Custom UI&quot;, swingui);
 *      }
 *  }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
