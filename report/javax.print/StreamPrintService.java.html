package javax.print;

import java.io.OutputStream;

/**
 * This class extends {@link PrintService} and represents a
 * print service that prints data in different formats to a
 * client-provided output stream.
 * This is principally intended for services where
 * the output format is a document type suitable for viewing
 * or archiving.
 * The output format must be declared as a mime type.
 * This is equivalent to an output document flavor where the
 * representation class is always &quot;java.io.OutputStream&quot;
 * An instance of the &lt;code&gt;StreamPrintService&lt;/code&gt; class is
 * obtained from a {@link StreamPrintServiceFactory} instance.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Note that a &lt;code&gt;StreamPrintService&lt;/code&gt; is different from a
 * &lt;code&gt;PrintService&lt;/code&gt;, which supports a
 * {@link javax.print.attribute.standard.Destination Destination}
 * attribute.  A &lt;code&gt;StreamPrintService&lt;/code&gt; always requires an output
 * stream, whereas a &lt;code&gt;PrintService&lt;/code&gt; optionally accepts a
 * &lt;code&gt;Destination&lt;/code&gt;. A &lt;code&gt;StreamPrintService&lt;/code&gt;
 * has no default destination for its formatted output.
 * Additionally a &lt;code&gt;StreamPrintService&lt;/code&gt; is expected to generate
output in
 * a format useful in other contexts.
 * StreamPrintService's are not expected to support the Destination attribute.
