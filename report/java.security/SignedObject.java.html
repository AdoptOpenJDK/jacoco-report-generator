/**
 * &lt;p&gt; SignedObject is a class for the purpose of creating authentic
 * runtime objects whose integrity cannot be compromised without being
 * detected.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; More specifically, a SignedObject contains another Serializable
 * object, the (to-be-)signed object and its signature.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The signed object is a &quot;deep copy&quot; (in serialized form) of an
 * original object.  Once the copy is made, further manipulation of
 * the original object has no side effect on the copy.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The underlying signing algorithm is designated by the Signature
 * object passed to the constructor and the {@code verify} method.
 * A typical usage for signing is the following:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * Signature signingEngine = Signature.getInstance(algorithm,
 *                                                 provider);
 * SignedObject so = new SignedObject(myobject, signingKey,
 *                                    signingEngine);
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A typical usage for verification is the following (having
 * received SignedObject {@code so}):
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 * Signature verificationEngine =
 *     Signature.getInstance(algorithm, provider);
 * if (so.verify(publickey, verificationEngine))
 *     try {
 *         Object myobj = so.getObject();
 *     } catch (java.lang.ClassNotFoundException e) {};
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Several points are worth noting.  First, there is no need to
 * initialize the signing or verification engine, as it will be
 * re-initialized inside the constructor and the {@code verify}
 * method. Secondly, for verification to succeed, the specified
 * public key must be the public key corresponding to the private key
 * used to generate the SignedObject.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; More importantly, for flexibility reasons, the
 * constructor and {@code verify} method allow for
 * customized signature engines, which can implement signature
 * algorithms that are not installed formally as part of a crypto
 * provider.  However, it is crucial that the programmer writing the
 * verifier code be aware what {@code Signature} engine is being
 * used, as its own implementation of the {@code verify} method
 * is invoked to verify a signature.  In other words, a malicious
 * {@code Signature} may choose to always return true on
 * verification in an attempt to bypass a security check.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The signature algorithm can be, among others, the NIST standard
 * DSA, using DSA and SHA-1.  The algorithm is specified using the
 * same convention as that for signatures. The DSA algorithm using the
 * SHA-1 message digest algorithm can be specified, for example, as
 * &quot;SHA/DSA&quot; or &quot;SHA-1/DSA&quot; (they are equivalent).  In the case of
 * RSA, there are multiple choices for the message digest algorithm,
 * so the signing algorithm could be specified as, for example,
 * &quot;MD2/RSA&quot;, &quot;MD5/RSA&quot; or &quot;SHA-1/RSA&quot;.  The algorithm name must be
 * specified, as there is no default.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; The name of the Cryptography Package Provider is designated
 * also by the Signature parameter to the constructor and the
 * {@code verify} method.  If the provider is not
 * specified, the default provider is used.  Each installation can
 * be configured to use a particular provider as default.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; Potential applications of SignedObject include:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt; It can be used
 * internally to any Java runtime as an unforgeable authorization
 * token -- one that can be passed around without the fear that the
 * token can be maliciously modified without being detected.
 * &lt;li&gt; It
 * can be used to sign and serialize data/object for storage outside
 * the Java runtime (e.g., storing critical access control data on
 * disk).
 * &lt;li&gt; Nested SignedObjects can be used to construct a logical
 * sequence of signatures, resembling a chain of authorization and
 * delegation.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
