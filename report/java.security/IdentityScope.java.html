/**
 * &lt;p&gt;This class represents a scope for identities. It is an Identity
 * itself, and therefore has a name and can have a scope. It can also
 * optionally have a public key and associated certificates.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;An IdentityScope can contain Identity objects of all kinds, including
 * Signers. All types of Identity objects can be retrieved, added, and
 * removed using the same methods. Note that it is possible, and in fact
 * expected, that different types of identity scopes will
 * apply different policies for their various operations on the
 * various types of Identities.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;There is a one-to-one mapping between keys and identities, and
 * there can only be one copy of one key per scope. For example, suppose
 * &lt;b&gt;Acme Software, Inc&lt;/b&gt; is a software publisher known to a user.
 * Suppose it is an Identity, that is, it has a public key, and a set of
 * associated certificates. It is named in the scope using the name
 * &quot;Acme Software&quot;. No other named Identity in the scope has the same
 * public  key. Of course, none has the same name as well.
 *
 * @see Identity
 * @see Signer
 * @see Principal
 * @see Key
 *
 * @author Benjamin Renaud
 *
 * @deprecated This class is no longer used. Its functionality has been
 * replaced by {@code java.security.KeyStore}, the
 * {@code java.security.cert} package, and
 * {@code java.security.Principal}.
