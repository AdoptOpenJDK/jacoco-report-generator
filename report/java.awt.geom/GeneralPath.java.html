 * The {@code GeneralPath} class represents a geometric path

 * (B&amp;eacute;zier) curves.  It can contain multiple subpaths.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * {@code GeneralPath} is a legacy final class which exactly
 * implements the behavior of its superclass {@link Path2D.Float}.
 * Together with {@link Path2D.Double}, the {@link Path2D} classes
 * provide full implementations of a general geometric path that
 * support all of the functionality of the {@link Shape} and
 * {@link PathIterator} interfaces with the ability to explicitly
 * select different levels of internal coordinate precision.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Use {@code Path2D.Float} (or this legacy {@code GeneralPath}
 * subclass) when dealing with data that can be represented
 * and used with floating point precision.  Use {@code Path2D.Double}
 * for data that requires the accuracy or range of double precision.
