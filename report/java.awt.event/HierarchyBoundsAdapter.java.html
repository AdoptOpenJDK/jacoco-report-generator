/**
 * An abstract adapter class for receiving ancestor moved and resized events.
 * The methods in this class are empty. This class exists as a
 * convenience for creating listener objects.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Extend this class and override the method for the event of interest. (If
 * you implement the &lt;code&gt;HierarchyBoundsListener&lt;/code&gt; interface, you have
 * to define both methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for
 * them both, so you only have to define the method for the event you care
 * about.)
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Create a listener object using your class and then register it with a
 * Component using the Component's &lt;code&gt;addHierarchyBoundsListener&lt;/code&gt;
 * method. When the hierarchy to which the Component belongs changes by
 * resize or movement of an ancestor, the relevant method in the listener
 * object is invoked, and the &lt;code&gt;HierarchyEvent&lt;/code&gt; is passed to it.
