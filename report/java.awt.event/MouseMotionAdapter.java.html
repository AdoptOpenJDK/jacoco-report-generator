/**
 * An abstract adapter class for receiving mouse motion events.
 * The methods in this class are empty. This class exists as
 * convenience for creating listener objects.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Mouse motion events occur when a mouse is moved or dragged.
 * (Many such events will be generated in a normal program.
 * To track clicks and other mouse events, use the MouseAdapter.)
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Extend this class to create a &lt;code&gt;MouseEvent&lt;/code&gt; listener
 * and override the methods for the events of interest. (If you implement the
 * &lt;code&gt;MouseMotionListener&lt;/code&gt; interface, you have to define all of
 * the methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them
 * all, so you can only have to define methods for events you care about.)
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with
 * a component using the component's &lt;code&gt;addMouseMotionListener&lt;/code&gt;
 * method. When the mouse is moved or dragged, the relevant method in the
 * listener object is invoked and the &lt;code&gt;MouseEvent&lt;/code&gt; is passed to it.
