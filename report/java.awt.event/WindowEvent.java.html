 * A low-level event that indicates that a window has changed its status. This
 * low-level event is generated by a Window object when it is opened, closed,
 * activated, deactivated, iconified, or deiconified, or when focus is
 * transfered into or out of the Window.
 * &lt;P&gt;
 * The event is passed to every &lt;code&gt;WindowListener&lt;/code&gt;
 * or &lt;code&gt;WindowAdapter&lt;/code&gt; object which registered to receive such
 * events using the window's &lt;code&gt;addWindowListener&lt;/code&gt; method.
 * (&lt;code&gt;WindowAdapter&lt;/code&gt; objects implement the
 * &lt;code&gt;WindowListener&lt;/code&gt; interface.) Each such listener object
 * gets this &lt;code&gt;WindowEvent&lt;/code&gt; when the event occurs.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An unspecified behavior will be caused if the {@code id} parameter
 * of any particular {@code WindowEvent} instance is not
 * in the range from {@code WINDOW_FIRST} to {@code WINDOW_LAST}.
