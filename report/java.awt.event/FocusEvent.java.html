/**
 * A low-level event which indicates that a Component has gained or lost the
 * input focus. This low-level event is generated by a Component (such as a
 * TextField). The event is passed to every &lt;code&gt;FocusListener&lt;/code&gt; or
 * &lt;code&gt;FocusAdapter&lt;/code&gt; object which registered to receive such events
 * using the Component's &lt;code&gt;addFocusListener&lt;/code&gt; method. (&lt;code&gt;
 * FocusAdapter&lt;/code&gt; objects implement the &lt;code&gt;FocusListener&lt;/code&gt;
 * interface.) Each such listener object gets this &lt;code&gt;FocusEvent&lt;/code&gt; when
 * the event occurs.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * There are two levels of focus events: permanent and temporary. Permanent
 * focus change events occur when focus is directly moved from one Component to
 * another, such as through a call to requestFocus() or as the user uses the
 * TAB key to traverse Components. Temporary focus change events occur when
 * focus is temporarily lost for a Component as the indirect result of another
 * operation, such as Window deactivation or a Scrollbar drag. In this case,
 * the original focus state will automatically be restored once that operation
 * is finished, or, for the case of Window deactivation, when the Window is
 * reactivated. Both permanent and temporary focus events are delivered using
 * the FOCUS_GAINED and FOCUS_LOST event ids; the level may be distinguished in
 * the event using the isTemporary() method.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * An unspecified behavior will be caused if the {@code id} parameter
 * of any particular {@code FocusEvent} instance is not
 * in the range from {@code FOCUS_FIRST} to {@code FOCUS_LAST}.
