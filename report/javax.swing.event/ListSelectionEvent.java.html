/**
 * An event that characterizes a change in selection. The change is limited to a
 * a single inclusive interval. The selection of at least one index within the
 * range will have changed. A decent {@code ListSelectionModel} implementation
 * will keep the range as small as possible. {@code ListSelectionListeners} will
 * generally query the source of the event for the new selected status of each
 * potentially changed row.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt;
 * Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 * future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 * appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 * the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 * of all JavaBeans&amp;trade;
 * has been added to the &lt;code&gt;java.beans&lt;/code&gt; package.
 * Please see {@link java.beans.XMLEncoder}.
