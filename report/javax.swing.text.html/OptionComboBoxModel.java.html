/**
 * OptionComboBoxModel extends the capabilities of the DefaultComboBoxModel,
 * to store the Option that is initially marked as selected.
 * This is stored, in order to enable an accurate reset of the
 * ComboBox that represents the SELECT form element when the
 * user requests a clear/reset.  Given that a combobox only allow
 * for one item to be selected, the last OPTION that has the
 * attribute set wins.
