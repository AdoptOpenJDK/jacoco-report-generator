/**
 * This class creates server sockets.  It may be subclassed by other
 * factories, which create particular types of server sockets.  This
 * provides a general framework for the addition of public socket-level
 * functionality.  It is the server side analogue of a socket factory,
 * and similarly provides a way to capture a variety of policies related
 * to the sockets being constructed.
 *
 * &lt;P&gt; Like socket factories, server Socket factory instances have
 * methods used to create sockets. There is also an environment
 * specific default server socket factory; frameworks will often use
 * their own customized factory.
