    /**
      * Creates a control using this control factory.
      *&lt;p&gt;
      * The factory is used by the service provider to return controls
      * that it reads from the LDAP protocol as specialized control classes.
      * Without this mechanism, the provider would be returning
      * controls that only contained data in BER encoded format.
      *&lt;p&gt;
      * Typically, &lt;tt&gt;ctl&lt;/tt&gt; is a &quot;basic&quot; control containing
      * BER encoded data. The factory is used to create a specialized
      * control implementation, usually by decoding the BER encoded data,
      * that provides methods to access that data in a type-safe and friendly
      * manner.
      * &lt;p&gt;
      * For example, a factory might use the BER encoded data in
      * basic control and return an instance of a VirtualListReplyControl.
      *&lt;p&gt;
      * If this factory cannot create a control using the argument supplied,
      * it should return null.
      * A factory should only throw an exception if it is sure that
      * it is the only intended factory and that no other control factories
      * should be tried. This might happen, for example, if the BER data
      * in the control does not match what is expected of a control with
      * the given OID. Since this method throws &lt;tt&gt;NamingException&lt;/tt&gt;,
      * any other internally generated exception that should be propagated
      * must be wrapped inside a &lt;tt&gt;NamingException&lt;/tt&gt;.
      *
      * @param ctl A non-null control.
      *
      * @return A possibly null Control.
      * @exception NamingException If &lt;tt&gt;ctl&lt;/tt&gt; contains invalid data that prevents it
      * from being used to create a control. A factory should only throw
      * an exception if it knows how to produce the control (identified by the OID)
      * but is unable to because of, for example invalid BER data.

      *&lt;ul&gt;
      * &lt;li&gt; Use the control factories specified in
      *    the &lt;tt&gt;LdapContext.CONTROL_FACTORIES&lt;/tt&gt; property of the
      *    environment, and of the provider resource file associated with
      *    &lt;tt&gt;ctx&lt;/tt&gt;, in that order.
      *    The value of this property is a colon-separated list of factory
      *    class names that are tried in order, and the first one that succeeds
      *    in creating the control is the one used.
      *    If none of the factories can be loaded,
      *    return &lt;code&gt;ctl&lt;/code&gt;.
      *    If an exception is encountered while creating the control, the
      *    exception is passed up to the caller.
      *&lt;/ul&gt;
      * &lt;p&gt;
      * Note that a control factory
      * must be public and must have a public constructor that accepts no arguments.
      * &lt;p&gt;
      * @param ctl The non-null control object containing the OID and BER data.
      * @param ctx The possibly null context in which the control is being created.
      * If null, no such information is available.
      * @param env The possibly null environment of the context. This is used
      * to find the value of the &lt;tt&gt;LdapContext.CONTROL_FACTORIES&lt;/tt&gt; property.
      * @return A control object created using &lt;code&gt;ctl&lt;/code&gt;; or
      *         &lt;code&gt;ctl&lt;/code&gt; if a control object cannot be created using
      *         the algorithm described above.
      * @exception NamingException if a naming exception was encountered
      *         while attempting to create the control object.
      *         If one of the factories accessed throws an
      *         exception, it is propagated up to the caller.
      * If an error was encountered while loading
      * and instantiating the factory and object classes, the exception
      * is wrapped inside a &lt;tt&gt;NamingException&lt;/tt&gt; and then rethrown.
