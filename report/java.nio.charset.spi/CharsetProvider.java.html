/**
 * Charset service-provider class.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A charset provider is a concrete subclass of this class that has a
 * zero-argument constructor and some number of associated charset
 * implementation classes.  Charset providers may be installed in an instance
 * of the Java platform as extensions, that is, jar files placed into any of
 * the usual extension directories.  Providers may also be made available by
 * adding them to the applet or application class path or by some other
 * platform-specific means.  Charset providers are looked up via the current
 * thread's {@link java.lang.Thread#getContextClassLoader() context class
 * loader}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A charset provider identifies itself with a provider-configuration file
 * named &lt;tt&gt;java.nio.charset.spi.CharsetProvider&lt;/tt&gt; in the resource
 * directory &lt;tt&gt;META-INF/services&lt;/tt&gt;.  The file should contain a list of
 * fully-qualified concrete charset-provider class names, one per line.  A line
 * is terminated by any one of a line feed (&lt;tt&gt;'\n'&lt;/tt&gt;), a carriage return
 * (&lt;tt&gt;'\r'&lt;/tt&gt;), or a carriage return followed immediately by a line feed.
 * Space and tab characters surrounding each name, as well as blank lines, are
 * ignored.  The comment character is &lt;tt&gt;'#'&lt;/tt&gt; (&lt;tt&gt;'&amp;#92;u0023'&lt;/tt&gt;); on
 * each line all characters following the first comment character are ignored.
 * The file must be encoded in UTF-8.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; If a particular concrete charset provider class is named in more than
 * one configuration file, or is named in the same configuration file more than
 * once, then the duplicates will be ignored.  The configuration file naming a
 * particular provider need not be in the same jar file or other distribution
 * unit as the provider itself.  The provider must be accessible from the same
 * class loader that was initially queried to locate the configuration file;
 * this is not necessarily the class loader that loaded the file. &lt;/p&gt;
