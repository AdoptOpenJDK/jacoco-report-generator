/**
 * The RenderQueue class encapsulates a RenderBuffer on which rendering
 * operations are enqueued.  Note that the RenderQueue lock must be acquired
 * before performing any operations on the queue (e.g. enqueuing an operation
 * or flushing the queue).  A sample usage scenario follows:
 *
 *     public void drawSomething(...) {
 *         rq.lock();
 *         try {
 *             ctx.validate(...);
 *             rq.ensureCapacity(4);
 *             rq.getBuffer().putInt(DRAW_SOMETHING);
 *             ...
 *         } finally {
 *             rq.unlock();
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 * If you are enqueuing an operation that involves 8-byte parameters (i.e.
 * long or double values), it is imperative that you ensure proper
 * alignment of the underlying RenderBuffer.  This can be accomplished
 * simply by providing an offset to the first 8-byte parameter in your
 * operation to the ensureCapacityAndAlignment() method.  For example:
 *
 *     public void drawStuff(...) {
 *         rq.lock();
 *         try {
 *             RenderBuffer buf = rq.getBuffer();
 *             ctx.validate(...);
 *             // 28 total bytes in the operation, 12 bytes to the first long
 *             rq.ensureCapacityAndAlignment(28, 12);
 *             buf.putInt(DRAW_STUFF);
 *             buf.putInt(x).putInt(y);
 *             buf.putLong(addr1);
 *             buf.putLong(addr2);
 *         } finally {
 *             rq.unlock();
 *         }
 *     }

         * the AWT lock before grabbing the RQ lock (see 6253009), while the
         * expected order should be RQ lock and then AWT lock.  Due to this
         * issue, using two separate locks is prone to deadlocks.  Therefore,
         * to solve this issue we have decided to eliminate the separate RQ
         * lock and instead just acquire the AWT lock here.  (Someday it might
         * be nice to go back to the old two-lock system, but that would
         * require potentially risky changes to AWT to ensure that it never
         * acquires the AWT lock before calling into 2D code that wants to
         * acquire the RQ lock.)
