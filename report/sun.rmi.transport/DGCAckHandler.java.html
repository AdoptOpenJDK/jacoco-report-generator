/**
 * Holds strong references to a set of remote objects, or live remote
 * references to remote objects, after they have been marshalled (as
 * remote references) as parts of the arguments or the result of a
 * remote invocation.  The purpose is to prevent remote objects or
 * live remote references that might otherwise be determined to be
 * unreachable in this VM from being locally garbage collected before
 * the receiver has had an opportunity to register the unmarshalled
 * remote references for DGC.
 *
 * The references are held strongly until an acknowledgment has been
 * received that the receiver has had an opportunity to process the
 * remote references or until a timeout has expired.  For remote
 * references sent as parts of the arguments of a remote invocation,
 * the acknowledgment is the beginning of the response indicating
 * completion of the remote invocation.  For remote references sent as
 * parts of the result of a remote invocation, a UID is included as
 * part of the result, and the acknowledgment is a transport-level
 * &quot;DGCAck&quot; message containing that UID.
