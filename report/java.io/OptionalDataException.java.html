 * Exception indicating the failure of an object read operation due to
 * unread primitive data, or the end of data belonging to a serialized
 * object in the stream.  This exception may be thrown in two cases:
 *
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 *   &lt;li&gt;An attempt was made to read an object when the next element in the
 *       stream is primitive data.  In this case, the OptionalDataException's
 *       length field is set to the number of bytes of primitive data
 *       immediately readable from the stream, and the eof field is set to
 *       false.
 *
 *   &lt;li&gt;An attempt was made to read past the end of data consumable by a
 *       class-defined readObject or readExternal method.  In this case, the
 *       OptionalDataException's eof field is set to true, and the length field
 *       is set to 0.
