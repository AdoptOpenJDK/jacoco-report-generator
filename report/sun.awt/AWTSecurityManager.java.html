/**
  * The AWTSecurityManager class provides the ability to secondarily
  * index AppContext objects through SecurityManager extensions.
  * As noted in AppContext.java, AppContexts are primarily indexed by
  * ThreadGroup.  In the case where the ThreadGroup doesn't provide
  * enough information to determine AppContext (e.g. system threads),
  * if a SecurityManager is installed which derives from
  * AWTSecurityManager, the AWTSecurityManager's getAppContext()
  * method is called to determine the AppContext.
  *
  * A typical example of the use of this class is where an applet
  * is called by a system thread, yet the system AppContext is
  * inappropriate, because applet code is currently executing.
  * In this case, the getAppContext() method can walk the call stack
  * to determine the applet code being executed and return the applet's
  * AppContext object.
