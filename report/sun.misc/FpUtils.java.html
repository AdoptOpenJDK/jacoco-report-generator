    /*
     * The methods in this class are reasonably implemented using
     * direct or indirect bit-level manipulation of floating-point
     * values.  However, having access to the IEEE 754 recommended
     * functions would obviate the need for most programmers to engage
     * in floating-point bit-twiddling.
     *
     * An IEEE 754 number has three fields, from most significant bit
     * to to least significant, sign, exponent, and significand.
     *
     *  msb                                lsb
     * [sign|exponent|  fractional_significand]
     *
     * Using some encoding cleverness, explained below, the high order
     * bit of the logical significand does not need to be explicitly
     * stored, thus &quot;fractional_significand&quot; instead of simply
     * &quot;significand&quot; in the figure above.
     *
     * For finite normal numbers, the numerical value encoded is
     *
     * (-1)^sign * 2^(exponent)*(1.fractional_significand)
     *
     * Most finite floating-point numbers are normalized; the exponent
     * value is reduced until the leading significand bit is 1.
     * Therefore, the leading 1 is redundant and is not explicitly
     * stored.  If a numerical value is so small it cannot be
     * normalized, it has a subnormal representation. Subnormal
     * numbers don't have a leading 1 in their significand; subnormals
     * are encoding using a special exponent value.  In other words,
     * the high-order bit of the logical significand can be elided in
     * from the representation in either case since the bit's value is
     * implicit from the exponent value.
     *
     * The exponent field uses a biased representation; if the bits of
     * the exponent are interpreted as a unsigned integer E, the
     * exponent represented is E - E_bias where E_bias depends on the
     * floating-point format.  E can range between E_min and E_max,
     * constants which depend on the floating-point format.  E_min and
     * E_max are -126 and +127 for float, -1022 and +1023 for double.
     *
     * The 32-bit float format has 1 sign bit, 8 exponent bits, and 23
     * bits for the significand (which is logically 24 bits wide
     * because of the implicit bit).  The 64-bit double format has 1
     * sign bit, 11 exponent bits, and 52 bits for the significand
     * (logically 53 bits).
     *
     * Subnormal numbers and zero have the special exponent value
     * E_min -1; the numerical value represented by a subnormal is:
     *
     * (-1)^sign * 2^(E_min)*(0.fractional_significand)
     *
     * Zero is represented by all zero bits in the exponent and all
     * zero bits in the significand; zero can have either sign.
     *
     * Infinity and NaN are encoded using the exponent value E_max +
     * 1.  Signed infinities have all significand bits zero; NaNs have
     * at least one non-zero significand bit.
     *
     * The details of IEEE 754 floating-point encoding will be used in
     * the methods below without further comment.  For further
     * exposition on IEEE 754 numbers, see &quot;IEEE Standard for Binary
     * Floating-Point Arithmetic&quot; ANSI/IEEE Std 754-1985 or William
     * Kahan's &quot;Lecture Notes on the Status of IEEE Standard 754 for
     * Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic&quot;,

     *
     * Many of this class's methods are members of the set of IEEE 754
     * recommended functions or similar functions recommended or
     * required by IEEE 754R.  Discussion of various implementation
     * techniques for these functions have occurred in:

     * Support the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point

     * The scalb operation should be reasonably fast; however, there
     * are tradeoffs in writing a method to minimize the worst case
     * performance and writing a method to minimize the time for
     * expected common inputs.  Some processors operate very slowly on
     * subnormal operands, taking hundreds or thousands of cycles for
     * one floating-point add or multiply as opposed to, say, four
     * cycles for normal operands.  For processors with very slow
     * subnormal execution, scalb would be fastest if written entirely
     * with integer operations; in other words, scalb would need to
     * include the logic of performing correct rounding of subnormal
     * values.  This could be reasonably done in at most a few hundred
     * cycles.  However, this approach may penalize normal operations
     * since at least the exponent of the floating-point argument must
     * be examined.
     *
     * The approach taken in this implementation is a compromise.
     * Floating-point multiplication is used to do most of the work;
     * but knowingly multiplying by a subnormal scaling factor is
     * avoided.  However, the floating-point argument is not examined
     * to see whether or not it is subnormal since subnormal inputs
     * are assumed to be rare.  At most three multiplies are needed to
     * scale from the largest to smallest exponent ranges (scaling
     * down, at most two multiplies are needed if subnormal scaling
     * factors are allowed).  However, in this implementation an
     * expensive integer remainder operation is avoided at the cost of
     * requiring five floating-point multiplies in the worst case,
     * which should still be a performance win.
     *
     * If scaling of entire arrays is a concern, it would probably be
     * more efficient to provide a double[] scalb(double[], int)
     * version of scalb to avoid having to recompute the needed
     * scaling factors for each floating-point value.
