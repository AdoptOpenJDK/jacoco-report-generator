/**
    A Timer object is used by algorithms that require timed events.
    For example, in an animation loop, a timer would help in
    determining when to change frames.

    A timer has an interval which determines when it &quot;ticks&quot;;
    that is, a timer delays for the specified interval and then
    it calls the owner's tick() method.

    Here's an example of creating a timer with a 5 sec interval:

    &lt;pre&gt;
    class Main implements Timeable {
        public void tick(Timer timer) {
            System.out.println(&quot;tick&quot;);
        }
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            (new Timer(this, 5000)).cont();
        }
    }
    &lt;/pre&gt;

    A timer can be stopped, continued, or reset at any time.
    A timer's state is not stopped while it's calling the
    owner's tick() method.

    A timer can be regular or irregular.  If in regular mode,
    a timer ticks at the specified interval, regardless of
    how long the owner's tick() method takes.  While the timer
    is running, no ticks are ever discarded.  That means that if
    the owner's tick() method takes longer than the interval,
    the ticks that would have occurred are delivered immediately.

    In irregular mode, a timer starts delaying for exactly
    the specified interval only after the tick() method returns.

    Synchronization issues: do not hold the timer's monitor
    while calling any of the Timer operations below otherwise
    the Timer class will deadlock.

/*
    Synchronization issues:  there are two data structures that
    require locking.  A Timer object and the Timer queue
    (described in the TimerThread class).  To avoid deadlock,
    the timer queue monitor is always acquired before the timer
    object's monitor.  However, the timer queue monitor is acquired
    only if the timer operation will make use of the timer
    queue, e.g. stop().

    The class monitor on the class TimerThread severs as the monitor
    to the timer queue.

    Possible feature: perhaps a timer should have an associated
    thread priority.  The thread that makes the callback temporarily
    takes on that priority before calling the owner's tick() method.

This class implements the timer queue and is exclusively used by the
Timer class.  There are only two methods exported to the Timer class -
enqueue, for inserting a timer into queue and dequeue, for removing
a timer from the queue.

A timer in the timer queue is awaiting a tick.  When a timer is to be
ticked, it is removed from the timer queue before the owner's tick()
method is called.

A single timer thread manages the timer queue.  This timer thread
looks at the head of the timer queue and delays until it's time for
the timer to tick.  When the time comes, the timer thread creates a
callback thread to call the timer owner's tick() method.  The timer
thread then processes the next timer in the queue.

When a timer is inserted at the head of the queue, the timer thread is
notified.  This causes the timer thread to prematurely wake up and
process the new head of the queue.
