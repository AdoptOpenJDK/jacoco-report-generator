/**
 * The Lock class provides a simple, useful interface to a lock.
 * Unlike monitors which synchronize access to an object, locks
 * synchronize access to an arbitrary set of resources (objects,
 * methods, variables, etc.). &lt;p&gt;
 *
 * The programmer using locks must be responsible for clearly defining
 * the semantics of their use and should handle deadlock avoidance in
 * the face of exceptions. &lt;p&gt;
 *
 * For example, if you want to protect a set of method invocations with
 * a lock, and one of the methods may throw an exception, you must be
 * prepared to release the lock similarly to the following example:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *      class SomeClass {
 *          Lock myLock = new Lock();

 *          void someMethod() {
 *              myLock.lock();
 *              try {
 *                  StartOperation();
 *                  ContinueOperation();
 *                  EndOperation();
 *              } finally {
 *                  myLock.unlock();
 *              }
 *          }
 *      }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
