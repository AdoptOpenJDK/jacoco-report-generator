 * ConditionLock is a Lock with a built in state variable.  This class
 * provides the ability to wait for the state variable to be set to a
 * desired value and then acquire the lock.&lt;p&gt;
 *
 * The lockWhen() and unlockWith() methods can be safely intermixed
 * with the lock() and unlock() methods. However if there is a thread
 * waiting for the state variable to become a particular value and you
 * simply call Unlock(), that thread will not be able to acquire the
 * lock until the state variable equals its desired value. &lt;p&gt;
