/**
 *
 * The ICC_ColorSpace class is an implementation of the abstract
 * ColorSpace class.  This representation of
 * device independent and device dependent color spaces is based on the
 * International Color Consortium Specification ICC.1:2001-12, File Format for
 * Color Profiles (see &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.color.org&quot;&gt;http://www.color.org&lt;/A&gt;).
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Typically, a Color or ColorModel would be associated with an ICC
 * Profile which is either an input, display, or output profile (see
 * the ICC specification).  There are other types of ICC Profiles, e.g.
 * abstract profiles, device link profiles, and named color profiles,
 * which do not contain information appropriate for representing the color
 * space of a color, image, or device (see ICC_Profile).
 * Attempting to create an ICC_ColorSpace object from an inappropriate ICC
 * Profile is an error.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * ICC Profiles represent transformations from the color space of
 * the profile (e.g. a monitor) to a Profile Connection Space (PCS).
 * Profiles of interest for tagging images or colors have a
 * PCS which is one of the device independent
 * spaces (one CIEXYZ space and two CIELab spaces) defined in the
 * ICC Profile Format Specification.  Most profiles of interest
 * either have invertible transformations or explicitly specify
 * transformations going both directions.  Should an ICC_ColorSpace
 * object be used in a way requiring a conversion from PCS to
 * the profile's native space and there is inadequate data to
 * correctly perform the conversion, the ICC_ColorSpace object will
 * produce output in the specified type of color space (e.g. TYPE_RGB,
 * TYPE_CMYK, etc.), but the specific color values of the output data
 * will be undefined.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The details of this class are not important for simple applets,
 * which draw in a default color space or manipulate and display
 * imported images with a known color space.  At most, such applets
 * would need to get one of the default color spaces via
 * ColorSpace.getInstance().

    /**
     * Transforms a color value assumed to be in this ColorSpace
     * into the CS_CIEXYZ conversion color space.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * This method transforms color values using relative colorimetry,
     * as defined by the ICC Specification.  This
     * means that the XYZ values returned by this method are represented
     * relative to the D50 white point of the CS_CIEXYZ color space.
     * This representation is useful in a two-step color conversion
     * process in which colors are transformed from an input color
     * space to CS_CIEXYZ and then to an output color space.  This
     * representation is not the same as the XYZ values that would
     * be measured from the given color value by a colorimeter.
     * A further transformation is necessary to compute the XYZ values
     * that would be measured using current CIE recommended practices.
     * The paragraphs below explain this in more detail.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The ICC standard uses a device independent color space (DICS) as the
     * mechanism for converting color from one device to another device.  In
     * this architecture, colors are converted from the source device's color
     * space to the ICC DICS and then from the ICC DICS to the destination
     * device's color space.  The ICC standard defines device profiles which
     * contain transforms which will convert between a device's color space
     * and the ICC DICS.  The overall conversion of colors from a source
     * device to colors of a destination device is done by connecting the
     * device-to-DICS transform of the profile for the source device to the
     * DICS-to-device transform of the profile for the destination device.
     * For this reason, the ICC DICS is commonly referred to as the profile
     * connection space (PCS).  The color space used in the methods
     * toCIEXYZ and fromCIEXYZ is the CIEXYZ PCS defined by the ICC
     * Specification.  This is also the color space represented by
     * ColorSpace.CS_CIEXYZ.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The XYZ values of a color are often represented as relative to some
     * white point, so the actual meaning of the XYZ values cannot be known
     * without knowing the white point of those values.  This is known as
     * relative colorimetry.  The PCS uses a white point of D50, so the XYZ
     * values of the PCS are relative to D50.  For example, white in the PCS
     * will have the XYZ values of D50, which is defined to be X=.9642,
     * Y=1.000, and Z=0.8249.  This white point is commonly used for graphic
     * arts applications, but others are often used in other applications.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * To quantify the color characteristics of a device such as a printer
     * or monitor, measurements of XYZ values for particular device colors
     * are typically made.  For purposes of this discussion, the term
     * device XYZ values is used to mean the XYZ values that would be
     * measured from device colors using current CIE recommended practices.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Converting between device XYZ values and the PCS XYZ values returned
     * by this method corresponds to converting between the device's color
     * space, as represented by CIE colorimetric values, and the PCS.  There
     * are many factors involved in this process, some of which are quite
     * subtle.  The most important, however, is the adjustment made to account
     * for differences between the device's white point and the white point of
     * the PCS.  There are many techniques for doing this and it is the
     * subject of much current research and controversy.  Some commonly used
     * methods are XYZ scaling, the von Kries transform, and the Bradford
     * transform.  The proper method to use depends upon each particular
     * application.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The simplest method is XYZ scaling.  In this method each device XYZ
     * value is  converted to a PCS XYZ value by multiplying it by the ratio
     * of the PCS white point (D50) to the device white point.
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     *
     * Xd, Yd, Zd are the device XYZ values
     * Xdw, Ydw, Zdw are the device XYZ white point values
     * Xp, Yp, Zp are the PCS XYZ values
     * Xd50, Yd50, Zd50 are the PCS XYZ white point values
     *
     * Xp = Xd * (Xd50 / Xdw)
     * Yp = Yd * (Yd50 / Ydw)
     * Zp = Zd * (Zd50 / Zdw)
     *
     * &lt;/pre&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Conversion from the PCS to the device would be done by inverting these
     * equations:
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     *
     * Xd = Xp * (Xdw / Xd50)
     * Yd = Yp * (Ydw / Yd50)
     * Zd = Zp * (Zdw / Zd50)
     *
     * &lt;/pre&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Note that the media white point tag in an ICC profile is not the same
     * as the device white point.  The media white point tag is expressed in
     * PCS values and is used to represent the difference between the XYZ of
     * device illuminant and the XYZ of the device media when measured under
     * that illuminant.  The device white point is expressed as the device
     * XYZ values corresponding to white displayed on the device.  For
     * example, displaying the RGB color (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) on an sRGB device
     * will result in a measured device XYZ value of D65.  This will not
     * be the same as the media white point tag XYZ value in the ICC
     * profile for an sRGB device.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * @param colorvalue a float array with length of at least the number
     *        of components in this ColorSpace.
     * @return a float array of length 3.
     * @throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if array length is not

    /**
     * Transforms a color value assumed to be in the CS_CIEXYZ conversion
     * color space into this ColorSpace.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * This method transforms color values using relative colorimetry,
     * as defined by the ICC Specification.  This
     * means that the XYZ argument values taken by this method are represented
     * relative to the D50 white point of the CS_CIEXYZ color space.
     * This representation is useful in a two-step color conversion
     * process in which colors are transformed from an input color
     * space to CS_CIEXYZ and then to an output color space.  The color
     * values returned by this method are not those that would produce
     * the XYZ value passed to the method when measured by a colorimeter.
     * If you have XYZ values corresponding to measurements made using
     * current CIE recommended practices, they must be converted to D50
     * relative values before being passed to this method.
     * The paragraphs below explain this in more detail.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The ICC standard uses a device independent color space (DICS) as the
     * mechanism for converting color from one device to another device.  In
     * this architecture, colors are converted from the source device's color
     * space to the ICC DICS and then from the ICC DICS to the destination
     * device's color space.  The ICC standard defines device profiles which
     * contain transforms which will convert between a device's color space
     * and the ICC DICS.  The overall conversion of colors from a source
     * device to colors of a destination device is done by connecting the
     * device-to-DICS transform of the profile for the source device to the
     * DICS-to-device transform of the profile for the destination device.
     * For this reason, the ICC DICS is commonly referred to as the profile
     * connection space (PCS).  The color space used in the methods
     * toCIEXYZ and fromCIEXYZ is the CIEXYZ PCS defined by the ICC
     * Specification.  This is also the color space represented by
     * ColorSpace.CS_CIEXYZ.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The XYZ values of a color are often represented as relative to some
     * white point, so the actual meaning of the XYZ values cannot be known
     * without knowing the white point of those values.  This is known as
     * relative colorimetry.  The PCS uses a white point of D50, so the XYZ
     * values of the PCS are relative to D50.  For example, white in the PCS
     * will have the XYZ values of D50, which is defined to be X=.9642,
     * Y=1.000, and Z=0.8249.  This white point is commonly used for graphic
     * arts applications, but others are often used in other applications.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * To quantify the color characteristics of a device such as a printer
     * or monitor, measurements of XYZ values for particular device colors
     * are typically made.  For purposes of this discussion, the term
     * device XYZ values is used to mean the XYZ values that would be
     * measured from device colors using current CIE recommended practices.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Converting between device XYZ values and the PCS XYZ values taken as
     * arguments by this method corresponds to converting between the device's
     * color space, as represented by CIE colorimetric values, and the PCS.
     * There are many factors involved in this process, some of which are quite
     * subtle.  The most important, however, is the adjustment made to account
     * for differences between the device's white point and the white point of
     * the PCS.  There are many techniques for doing this and it is the
     * subject of much current research and controversy.  Some commonly used
     * methods are XYZ scaling, the von Kries transform, and the Bradford
     * transform.  The proper method to use depends upon each particular
     * application.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The simplest method is XYZ scaling.  In this method each device XYZ
     * value is  converted to a PCS XYZ value by multiplying it by the ratio
     * of the PCS white point (D50) to the device white point.
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     *
     * Xd, Yd, Zd are the device XYZ values
     * Xdw, Ydw, Zdw are the device XYZ white point values
     * Xp, Yp, Zp are the PCS XYZ values
     * Xd50, Yd50, Zd50 are the PCS XYZ white point values
     *
     * Xp = Xd * (Xd50 / Xdw)
     * Yp = Yd * (Yd50 / Ydw)
     * Zp = Zd * (Zd50 / Zdw)
     *
     * &lt;/pre&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Conversion from the PCS to the device would be done by inverting these
     * equations:
     * &lt;pre&gt;
     *
     * Xd = Xp * (Xdw / Xd50)
     * Yd = Yp * (Ydw / Yd50)
     * Zd = Zp * (Zdw / Zd50)
     *
     * &lt;/pre&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Note that the media white point tag in an ICC profile is not the same
     * as the device white point.  The media white point tag is expressed in
     * PCS values and is used to represent the difference between the XYZ of
     * device illuminant and the XYZ of the device media when measured under
     * that illuminant.  The device white point is expressed as the device
     * XYZ values corresponding to white displayed on the device.  For
     * example, displaying the RGB color (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) on an sRGB device
     * will result in a measured device XYZ value of D65.  This will not
     * be the same as the media white point tag XYZ value in the ICC
     * profile for an sRGB device.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * @param colorvalue a float array with length of at least 3.
     * @return a float array with length equal to the number of
     *         components in this ColorSpace.
     * @throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if array length is not
     * at least 3.
