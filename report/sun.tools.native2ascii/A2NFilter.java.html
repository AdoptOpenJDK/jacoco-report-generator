/**
 * This FilterReader class processes a sequence of characters from

 * 'back-tick U' escaped sequences representing characters which have
 * the possibility of being encoded in a user specified encoding
 * The filter relies on knowing the target encoding and makes a
 * determination as to whether a given supplied character in its
 * source character stream is encodeable in the target encoding.
 * If not, it is remains in its back-tick U escaped form.
