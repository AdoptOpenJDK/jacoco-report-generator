 * A {@code VolatileCallSite} is a {@link CallSite} whose target acts like a volatile variable.
 * An {@code invokedynamic} instruction linked to a {@code VolatileCallSite} sees updates
 * to its call site target immediately, even if the update occurs in another thread.
 * There may be a performance penalty for such tight coupling between threads.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Unlike {@code MutableCallSite}, there is no
 * {@linkplain MutableCallSite#syncAll syncAll operation} on volatile
 * call sites, since every write to a volatile variable is implicitly
 * synchronized with reader threads.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * In other respects, a {@code VolatileCallSite} is interchangeable
 * with {@code MutableCallSite}.
