/* These are font metrics: they are in user space, not device space.
 * Hence they are not truly &quot;strike&quot; metrics. However it is convenient to
 * treat them as such since we need to have a scaler context to obtain them
 * and also to cache them. The old implementation obtained a C++ strike object
 * that matched the Font TX + pt size only. It was wasteful of strike objects.
 * This new implementation still has separate StrikeMetrics for 2 fonts that
 * are really the same but are used in different device transforms, but at
 * least it doesn't create a whole new strike just to get the metrics for
 * a strike in a transformed graphics.
 * So these metrics do not take into account the device transform. They
 * are considered inherent properties of the font. Hence it may be that we
 * should use the device transform to obtain the most accurate metrics, but
 * typically 1.1 APIs do not provide for this. So some APIs may want to
 * ignore the dev. tx and others may want to use it, and then apply an
 * inverse transform. For now we ignore the dev. tx.
 * &quot;Font&quot; metrics are representative of a typical glyph in the font.
 * Generally speaking these values are the choice of the font designer and
 * are stored in the font, from which we retrieve the values. They do
 * not necessarily equate to the maximum bounds of all glyphs in the font.
 * Note that the ascent fields are typically a -ve value as we use a top-left
 * origin user space, and text is positioned relative to its baseline.

    /* The no-args constructor is used by CompositeStrike, which then
     * merges in the metrics of physical fonts.
     * The approach here is the same as earlier releases but it is flawed
     * take for example the following which ignores leading for simplicity.
     * Say we have a composite with an element asc=-9, dsc=2, and another with
     * asc=-7, dsc=3.  The merged font is (-9,3) for height of -(-9)+3=12.
     * Suppose this same font has been derived with a 180% rotation
     * Now its signs for ascent/descent are reversed. Its (9,-2) and (7,-3)
     * Its merged values are (using the code in this class) (7,-2) for
     * a height of -(7)+-2 = =-9!
     * We need to have a more intelligent merging algorithm,
     * which so far as I can see needs to apply an inverse of the font
     * tx, do its merging, and then reapply the font tx.
     * This wouldn't often be a problem as there rarely is a font TX, and
     * the tricky part is getting the information. Probably the no-args
     * constructor needs to pass a TX in to be applied to all merges.
     * CompositeStrike would be left with the problem of figuring out what
     * tx to use.
     * But at least for now we are probably no worse than 1.4 ...
     * REMIND: FIX THIS.
