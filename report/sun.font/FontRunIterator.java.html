     * characters that are in the 'common' script become part of the
     * surrounding script run.  we want to fetch these from the same font
     * used to get surrounding characters, where possible.  but we don't
     * want to force non-common characters to come from other than their
     * standard font.
     *
     * what we really want to do is this:
     * 1) fetch a code point from the text.
     * 2) get its 'native' script code
     * 3) determine its 'resolved' script code
     * 4) if its native script is COMMON, and its resolved script is the same as the previous
     *    code point's, then see if the previous font supports this code point.  if so, use it.
     * 5) otherwise resolve the font as usual
     * 6) break the run when either the physical font or the resolved script changes.
     *
     * problems: we optimize latin-1 and cjk text assuming a fixed
     * width for each character.  since latin-1 digits and punctuation
     * are common, following this algorithm they will change to match
     * the fonts used for the preceding text, and potentially change metrics.
     *
     * this also seems to have the potential for changing arbitrary runs of text, e.g.
     * any number of digits and spaces can change depending on the preceding (or following!)
     * non-COMMON character's font assignment.  this is not good.
     *
     * since the goal is to enable layout to be performed using as few physical fonts as
     * possible, and the primary cause of switching fonts is to handle spaces, perhaps
     * we should just special-case spaces and assign them from the current font, whatever
     * it may be.
     *
     * One could also argue that the job of the composite font is to assign physical fonts
     * to text runs, however it wishes.  we don't necessarily have to provide script info
     * to let it do this.  it can determine based on whatever.  so having a special 'next'
     * function that takes script (and limit) is redundant.  It can fetch the script again
     * if need be.
     *
     * both this and the script iterator are turning char sequences into code point
     * sequences.  maybe it would be better to feed a single code point into each iterator-- push
     * the data instead of pull it?
