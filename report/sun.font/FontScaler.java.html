/* FontScaler is &quot;internal interface&quot; to font rasterizer library.
 *
 * Access to native rasterizers without going through this interface is
 * strongly discouraged. In particular, this is important because native
 * data could be disposed due to runtime font processing error at any time.
 *
 * FontScaler represents combination of particular rasterizer implementation
 * and particular font. It does not include rasterization attributes such as
 * transform. These attributes are part of native scalerContext object.
 * This approach allows to share same scaler for different requests related
 * to the same font file.
 *
 * Note that scaler may throw FontScalerException on any operation.
 * Generally this means that runtime error had happened and scaler is not
 * usable.  Subsequent calls to this scaler should not cause crash but will
 * likely cause exceptions to be thrown again.
 *
 * It is recommended that callee should replace its reference to the scaler
 * with something else. For instance it could be FontManager.getNullScaler().
 * Note that NullScaler is trivial and will not actually rasterize anything.
 *
 * Alternatively, callee can use more sophisticated error recovery strategies
 * and for instance try to substitute failed scaler with new scaler instance
 * using another font.
 *
 * Note that in case of error there is no need to call dispose(). Moreover,
 * dispose() generally is called by Disposer thread and explicit calls to
 * dispose might have unexpected sideeffects because scaler can be shared.
 *
 * Current disposing logic is the following:
 *   - scaler is registered in the Disposer by the FontManager (on creation)
 *   - scalers are disposed when associated Font2D object (e.g. TruetypeFont)
 *     is garbage collected. That's why this object implements DisposerRecord
 *     interface directly (as it is not used as indicator when it is safe
 *     to release native state) and that's why we have to use WeakReference
 *     to Font internally.
 *   - Majority of Font2D objects are linked from various mapping arrays
 *     (e.g. FontManager.localeFullNamesToFont). So, they are not collected.
 *     This logic only works for fonts created with Font.createFont()
 *
 *  Notes:
 *   - Eventually we may consider releasing some of the scaler resources if
 *     it was not used for a while but we do not want to be too aggressive on
 *     this (and this is probably more important for Type1 fonts).
