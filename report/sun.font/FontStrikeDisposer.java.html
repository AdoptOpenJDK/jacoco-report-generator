/*
 * This keeps track of data that needs to be cleaned up once a
 * strike is freed.
 * a) The native memory that is the glyph image cache.
 * b) removing the &quot;desc&quot; key from the strike's map.
 * This is safe to do because this disposer is invoked only when the
 * reference object has been cleared, which means the value indexed by
 * this key is just an empty reference object.
 * It is possible that a new FontStrike has been created that would
 * be referenced by the same (equals) key. If it is placed in the map
 * before this disposer is executed, then we do not want to remove that
 * object. We should only remove an object where the value is null.
 * So we first verify that the key still points to a cleared reference.
 * Updates to the map thus need to be synchronized.
 *
 * A WeakHashmap will automatically clean up, but we might maintain a
 * reference to the &quot;desc&quot; key in the FontStrike (value) which would
 * prevent the keys from being discarded. And since the strike is the only
 * place is likely we would maintain such a strong reference, then the map
 * entries would be removed much more promptly than we need.
