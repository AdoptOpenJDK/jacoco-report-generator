/**
 * One or more variables that together maintain an initially zero
 * {@code double} sum.  When updates (method {@link #add}) are
 * contended across threads, the set of variables may grow dynamically
 * to reduce contention.  Method {@link #sum} (or, equivalently {@link
 * #doubleValue}) returns the current total combined across the
 * variables maintaining the sum. The order of accumulation within or
 * across threads is not guaranteed. Thus, this class may not be
 * applicable if numerical stability is required, especially when
 * combining values of substantially different orders of magnitude.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This class is usually preferable to alternatives when multiple
 * threads update a common value that is used for purposes such as
 * summary statistics that are frequently updated but less frequently
 * read.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This class extends {@link Number}, but does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; define
 * methods such as {@code equals}, {@code hashCode} and {@code
 * compareTo} because instances are expected to be mutated, and so are
 * not useful as collection keys.
