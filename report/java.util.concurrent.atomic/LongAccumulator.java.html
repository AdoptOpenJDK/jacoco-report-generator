/**
 * One or more variables that together maintain a running {@code long}
 * value updated using a supplied function.  When updates (method
 * {@link #accumulate}) are contended across threads, the set of variables
 * may grow dynamically to reduce contention.  Method {@link #get}
 * (or, equivalently, {@link #longValue}) returns the current value
 * across the variables maintaining updates.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This class is usually preferable to {@link AtomicLong} when
 * multiple threads update a common value that is used for purposes such
 * as collecting statistics, not for fine-grained synchronization
 * control.  Under low update contention, the two classes have similar
 * characteristics. But under high contention, expected throughput of
 * this class is significantly higher, at the expense of higher space
 * consumption.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;The order of accumulation within or across threads is not
 * guaranteed and cannot be depended upon, so this class is only
 * applicable to functions for which the order of accumulation does
 * not matter. The supplied accumulator function should be
 * side-effect-free, since it may be re-applied when attempted updates
 * fail due to contention among threads. The function is applied with
 * the current value as its first argument, and the given update as
 * the second argument.  For example, to maintain a running maximum
 * value, you could supply {@code Long::max} along with {@code
 * Long.MIN_VALUE} as the identity.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Class {@link LongAdder} provides analogs of the functionality of
 * this class for the common special case of maintaining counts and
 * sums.  The call {@code new LongAdder()} is equivalent to {@code new
 * LongAccumulator((x, y) -&gt; x + y, 0L}.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This class extends {@link Number}, but does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; define
 * methods such as {@code equals}, {@code hashCode} and {@code
 * compareTo} because instances are expected to be mutated, and so are
 * not useful as collection keys.
