/**
 * {@code RMISecurityManager} implements a policy identical to the policy
 * implemented by {@link SecurityManager}. RMI applications
 * should use the {@code SecurityManager} class or another appropriate
 * {@code SecurityManager} implementation instead of this class. RMI's class
 * loader will download classes from remote locations only if a security
 * manager has been set.
 *
 * @implNote
 * &lt;p&gt;Applets typically run in a container that already has a security
 * manager, so there is generally no need for applets to set a security
 * manager. If you have a standalone application, you might need to set a
 * {@code SecurityManager} in order to enable class downloading. This can be
 * done by adding the following to your code. (It needs to be executed before
 * RMI can download code from remote hosts, so it most likely needs to appear
 * in the {@code main} method of your application.)
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;{@code
 *    if (System.getSecurityManager() == null) {
 *        System.setSecurityManager(new SecurityManager());
 *    }
 * }&lt;/pre&gt;
