/**
 * This interface is used to track changes to the complex data of an
 * object that implements the StateTrackable interface.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The usage pattern for code accessing the trackable data is as follows:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *     StateTrackable trackedobject;
 *     MyInfo cacheddata;
 *     StateTracker cachetracker;
 *     public synchronized MyInfo getInfoAbout(StateTrackable obj) {
 *         if (trackedobject != obj || !cachetracker.isCurrent()) {
 *             // Note: Always call getStateTracker() before
 *             // caching any data about the objct...
 *             cachetracker = obj.getStateTracker();
 *             cacheddata = calculateInfoFrom(obj);
 *             trackedobject = obj;
 *         }
 *         return cacheddata;
 *     }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * Note that the sample code above works correctly regardless of the
 * {@link StateTrackable.State State} of the complex data of the object,
 * but it may be inefficient to store precalculated information about
 * an object whose current {@link StateTrackable.State State} is
 * {@link StateTrackable.State#UNTRACKABLE UNTRACKABLE}
 * and it is unnecessary to perform the {@link #isCurrent} test for
 * data whose current {@link StateTrackable.State State} is
 * {@link StateTrackable.State#IMMUTABLE IMMUTABLE}.
 * Optimizations to the sample code for either or both of those terminal
 * States may be of benefit for some use cases, but is left out of the
 * example to reduce its complexity.
 *
 * @see StateTrackable.State
 * @since 1.7
