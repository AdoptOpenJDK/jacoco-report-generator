/**
  * This class represents an event fired by a naming/directory service.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * The &lt;tt&gt;NamingEvent&lt;/tt&gt;'s state consists of
  * &lt;ul&gt;
  * &lt;li&gt;The event source: the &lt;tt&gt;EventContext&lt;/tt&gt; which fired this event.
  * &lt;li&gt;The event type.
  * &lt;li&gt;The new binding: information about the object after the change.
  * &lt;li&gt;The old binding: information about the object before the change.
  * &lt;li&gt;Change information: information about the change
  * that triggered this event; usually service provider-specific or server-specific
  * information.
  * &lt;/ul&gt;
  * &lt;p&gt;
  * Note that the event source is always the same &lt;tt&gt;EventContext&lt;/tt&gt;
  * &lt;em&gt;instance&lt;/em&gt;  that the listener has registered with.
  * Furthermore, the names of the bindings in
  * the &lt;tt&gt;NamingEvent&lt;/tt&gt; are always relative to that instance.
  * For example, suppose a listener makes the following registration:
  *&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
  *     NamespaceChangeListener listener = ...;
  *     src.addNamingListener(&quot;x&quot;, SUBTREE_SCOPE, listener);
  *&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  * When an object named &quot;x/y&quot; is subsequently deleted, the corresponding
  * &lt;tt&gt;NamingEvent&lt;/tt&gt; (&lt;tt&gt;evt&lt;/tt&gt;) must contain:
  *&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
  *     evt.getEventContext() == src
  *     evt.getOldBinding().getName().equals(&quot;x/y&quot;)
  *&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  *
  * Care must be taken when multiple threads are accessing the same
  * &lt;tt&gt;EventContext&lt;/tt&gt; concurrently.
  * See the
  * &lt;a href=package-summary.html#THREADING&gt;package description&lt;/a&gt;
  * for more information on threading issues.
