        /*
         * Java 2D font point sizes are in a user-space scale of 72dpi.
         * GTK allows a user to configure a &quot;dpi&quot; property used to scale
         * the fonts used to match a user's preference.
         * To match the font size of GTK apps we need to obtain this DPI and
         * adjust as follows:
         * Some versions of GTK use XSETTINGS if available to dynamically
         * monitor user-initiated changes in the DPI to be used by GTK
         * apps. This value is also made available as the Xft.dpi X resource.
         * This is presumably a function of the font preferences API and/or
         * the manner in which it requests the toolkit to update the default
         * for the desktop. This dual approach is probably necessary since
         * other versions of GTK - or perhaps some apps - determine the size
         * to use only at start-up from that X resource.
         * If that resource is not set then GTK scales for the DPI resolution
         * reported by the Xserver using the formula
         * DisplayHeight(dpy, screen) / DisplayHeightMM(dpy, screen) * 25.4
         * (25.4mm == 1 inch).
         * JDK tracks the Xft.dpi XSETTINGS property directly so it can
         * dynamically change font size by tracking just that value.
         * If that resource is not available use the same fall back formula
         * as GTK (see calculation for fontScale).
         *
         * GTK's default setting for Xft.dpi is 96 dpi (and it seems -1
         * apparently also can mean that &quot;default&quot;). However this default
         * isn't used if there's no property set. The real default in the
         * absence of a resource is the Xserver reported dpi.
         * Finally this DPI is used to calculate the nearest Java 2D font
         * 72 dpi font size.
         * There are cases in which JDK behaviour may not exactly mimic
         * GTK native app behaviour :
         * 1) When a GTK app is not able to dynamically track the changes
         * (does not use XSETTINGS), JDK will resize but other apps will
         * not. This is OK as JDK is exhibiting preferred behaviour and
         * this is probably how all later GTK apps will behave
         * 2) When a GTK app does not use XSETTINGS and for some reason
         * the XRDB property is not present. JDK will pick up XSETTINGS
         * and the GTK app will use the Xserver default. Since its
         * impossible for JDK to know that some other GTK app is not
         * using XSETTINGS its impossible to account for this and in any
         * case for it to be a problem the values would have to be different.
         * It also seems unlikely to arise except when a user explicitly
         * deletes the X resource database entry.
         * There also some other issues to be aware of for the future:
         * GTK specifies the Xft.dpi value as server-wide which when used
         * on systems with 2 distinct X screens with different physical DPI
         * the font sizes will inevitably appear different. It would have
         * been a more user-friendly design to further adjust that one
         * setting depending on the screen resolution to achieve perceived
         * equivalent sizes. If such a change were ever to be made in GTK
         * we would need to update for that.
