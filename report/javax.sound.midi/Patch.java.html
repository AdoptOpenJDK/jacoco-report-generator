/**
 * A &lt;code&gt;Patch&lt;/code&gt; object represents a location, on a MIDI
 * synthesizer, into which a single instrument is stored (loaded).
 * Every &lt;code&gt;Instrument&lt;/code&gt; object has its own &lt;code&gt;Patch&lt;/code&gt;
 * object that specifies the memory location
 * into which that instrument should be loaded. The
 * location is specified abstractly by a bank index and a program number (not by
 * any scheme that directly refers to a specific address or offset in RAM).
 * This is a hierarchical indexing scheme: MIDI provides for up to 16384 banks,
 * each of which contains up to 128 program locations.  For example, a
 * minimal sort of synthesizer might have only one bank of instruments, and
 * only 32 instruments (programs) in that bank.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * To select what instrument should play the notes on a particular MIDI
 * channel, two kinds of MIDI message are used that specify a patch location:
 * a bank-select command, and a program-change channel command.  The Java Sound
 * equivalent is the
 * {@link MidiChannel#programChange(int, int) programChange(int, int)}
 * method of &lt;code&gt;MidiChannel&lt;/code&gt;.
 *

 * @see Instrument#getPatch()
