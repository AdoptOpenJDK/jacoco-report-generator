/**
 * An instrument is a sound-synthesis algorithm with certain parameter
 * settings, usually designed to emulate a specific real-world
 * musical instrument or to achieve a specific sort of sound effect.
 * Instruments are typically stored in collections called soundbanks.
 * Before the instrument can be used to play notes, it must first be loaded
 * onto a synthesizer, and then it must be selected for use on
 * one or more channels, via a program-change command.  MIDI notes
 * that are subsequently received on those channels will be played using
 * the sound of the selected instrument.
