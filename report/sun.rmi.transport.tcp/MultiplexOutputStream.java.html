 * point it attempts to push a packet of bytes through to the remote
 * endpoint.  This will never push more bytes than the amount already
 * requested by the remote endpoint (to prevent receive buffer from
 * overflowing), so if the write() and flush() methods will block
 * until their operation can complete if enough bytes cannot be
 * pushed immediately.
