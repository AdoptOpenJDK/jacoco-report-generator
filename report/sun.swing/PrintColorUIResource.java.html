     * Replaces this object with a plain {@code ColorUIResource} during

     * sun.swing package, access can be disallowed to it by a security
     * manager. When access is disallowed, deserialization of any object
     * with reference to a {@code PrintColorUIResource} fails.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Since {@code PrintColorUIResource) is used only by Swing's look
     * and feels, and we know that UI supplied colors are replaced after
     * deserialization when the UI is re-installed, the only important
     * aspect of the {@code PrintColorUIResource} that needs to be
     * persisted is the fact that it is a {@code ColorUIResource}. As
     * such, we can avoid the problem outlined above by replacing
     * the problematic {@code PrintColorUIResource} with a plain
     * {@code ColorUIResource}.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * Note: As a result of this method, it is not possible to write
     * a {@code PrintColorUIResource} to a stream and then read
     * back a {@code PrintColorUIResource}. This is acceptable since we
     * don't have a requirement for that in Swing.
