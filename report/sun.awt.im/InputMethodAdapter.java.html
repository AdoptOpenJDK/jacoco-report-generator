/**
 * An input method adapter interfaces with the native input methods
 * on a host platform. In general, it looks to the input method
 * framework like a Java input method (that may support a few more
 * locales than a typical Java input method). However, since it
 * often has to work in a slightly hostile environment that's not
 * designed for easy integration into the Java input method
 * framework, it gets some special treatment that's not available
 * to Java input methods.
 * &lt;p&gt;
