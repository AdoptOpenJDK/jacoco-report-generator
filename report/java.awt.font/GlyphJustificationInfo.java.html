/**
 * The &lt;code&gt;GlyphJustificationInfo&lt;/code&gt; class represents information
 * about the justification properties of a glyph.  A glyph is the visual
 * representation of one or more characters.  Many different glyphs can
 * be used to represent a single character or combination of characters.
 * The four justification properties represented by
 * &lt;code&gt;GlyphJustificationInfo&lt;/code&gt; are weight, priority, absorb and
 * limit.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Weight is the overall 'weight' of the glyph in the line.  Generally it is
 * proportional to the size of the font.  Glyphs with larger weight are
 * allocated a correspondingly larger amount of the change in space.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Priority determines the justification phase in which this glyph is used.
 * All glyphs of the same priority are examined before glyphs of the next
 * priority.  If all the change in space can be allocated to these glyphs
 * without exceeding their limits, then glyphs of the next priority are not
 * examined. There are four priorities, kashida, whitespace, interchar,
 * and none.  KASHIDA is the first priority examined. NONE is the last
 * priority examined.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Absorb determines whether a glyph absorbs all change in space.  Within a
 * given priority, some glyphs may absorb all the change in space.  If any of
 * these glyphs are present, no glyphs of later priority are examined.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Limit determines the maximum or minimum amount by which the glyph can
 * change. Left and right sides of the glyph can have different limits.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Each &lt;code&gt;GlyphJustificationInfo&lt;/code&gt; represents two sets of
 * metrics, which are &lt;i&gt;growing&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;shrinking&lt;/i&gt;.  Growing
 * metrics are used when the glyphs on a line are to be
 * spread apart to fit a larger width.  Shrinking metrics are used when
 * the glyphs are to be moved together to fit a smaller width.
