/**
 * The &lt;code&gt;GlyphMetrics&lt;/code&gt; class represents information for a
 * single glyph.   A glyph is the visual representation of one or more
 * characters.  Many different glyphs can be used to represent a single
 * character or combination of characters.  &lt;code&gt;GlyphMetrics&lt;/code&gt;
 * instances are produced by {@link java.awt.Font Font} and are applicable
 * to a specific glyph in a particular &lt;code&gt;Font&lt;/code&gt;.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Glyphs are either STANDARD, LIGATURE, COMBINING, or COMPONENT.
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;STANDARD glyphs are commonly used to represent single characters.
 * &lt;li&gt;LIGATURE glyphs are used to represent sequences of characters.
 * &lt;li&gt;COMPONENT glyphs in a {@link GlyphVector} do not correspond to a
 * particular character in a text model. Instead, COMPONENT glyphs are
 * added for typographical reasons, such as Arabic justification.
 * &lt;li&gt;COMBINING glyphs embellish STANDARD or LIGATURE glyphs, such
 * as accent marks.  Carets do not appear before COMBINING glyphs.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Other metrics available through &lt;code&gt;GlyphMetrics&lt;/code&gt; are the
 * components of the advance, the visual bounds, and the left and right
 * side bearings.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Glyphs for a rotated font, or obtained from a &lt;code&gt;GlyphVector&lt;/code&gt;
 * which has applied a rotation to the glyph, can have advances that
 * contain both X and Y components.  Usually the advance only has one
 * component.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The advance of a glyph is the distance from the glyph's origin to the
 * origin of the next glyph along the baseline, which is either vertical
 * or horizontal.  Note that, in a &lt;code&gt;GlyphVector&lt;/code&gt;,
 * the distance from a glyph to its following glyph might not be the
 * glyph's advance, because of kerning or other positioning adjustments.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The bounds is the smallest rectangle that completely contains the
 * outline of the glyph.  The bounds rectangle is relative to the
 * glyph's origin.  The left-side bearing is the distance from the glyph
 * origin to the left of its bounds rectangle. If the left-side bearing is
 * negative, part of the glyph is drawn to the left of its origin.  The
 * right-side bearing is the distance from the right side of the bounds
 * rectangle to the next glyph origin (the origin plus the advance).  If
 * negative, part of the glyph is drawn to the right of the next glyph's
 * origin.  Note that the bounds does not necessarily enclose all the pixels
 * affected when rendering the glyph, because of rasterization and pixel
 * adjustment effects.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Although instances of &lt;code&gt;GlyphMetrics&lt;/code&gt; can be directly
 * constructed, they are almost always obtained from a
 * &lt;code&gt;GlyphVector&lt;/code&gt;.  Once constructed, &lt;code&gt;GlyphMetrics&lt;/code&gt;
 * objects are immutable.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;p&gt;
 * Querying a &lt;code&gt;Font&lt;/code&gt; for glyph information
 * &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
 * Font font = ...;
 * int glyphIndex = ...;
 * GlyphMetrics metrics = GlyphVector.getGlyphMetrics(glyphIndex);
 * int isStandard = metrics.isStandard();
 * float glyphAdvance = metrics.getAdvance();
 * &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 * @see java.awt.Font
 * @see GlyphVector
