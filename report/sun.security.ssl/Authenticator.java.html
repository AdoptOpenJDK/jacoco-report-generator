/**
 * This class represents an SSL/TLS message authentication token,
 * which encapsulates a sequence number and ensures that attempts to
 * delete or reorder messages can be detected.
 *
 * Each SSL/TLS connection state contains a sequence number, which
 * is maintained separately for read and write states.  The sequence
 * number MUST be set to zero whenever a connection state is made the
 * active state.  Sequence numbers are of type uint64 and may not
 * exceed 2^64-1.  Sequence numbers do not wrap.  If a SSL/TLS
 * implementation would need to wrap a sequence number, it must
 * renegotiate instead.  A sequence number is incremented after each
 * record: specifically, the first record transmitted under a
 * particular connection state MUST use sequence number 0.
