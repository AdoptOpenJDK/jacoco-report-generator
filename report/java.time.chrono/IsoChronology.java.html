/**
 * The ISO calendar system.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This chronology defines the rules of the ISO calendar system.
 * This calendar system is based on the ISO-8601 standard, which is the
 * &lt;i&gt;de facto&lt;/i&gt; world calendar.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The fields are defined as follows:
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt;era - There are two eras, 'Current Era' (CE) and 'Before Current Era' (BCE).
 * &lt;li&gt;year-of-era - The year-of-era is the same as the proleptic-year for the current CE era.
 *  For the BCE era before the ISO epoch the year increases from 1 upwards as time goes backwards.
 * &lt;li&gt;proleptic-year - The proleptic year is the same as the year-of-era for the
 *  current era. For the previous era, years have zero, then negative values.
 * &lt;li&gt;month-of-year - There are 12 months in an ISO year, numbered from 1 to 12.
 * &lt;li&gt;day-of-month - There are between 28 and 31 days in each of the ISO month, numbered from 1 to 31.
 *  Months 4, 6, 9 and 11 have 30 days, Months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 12 have 31 days.
 *  Month 2 has 28 days, or 29 in a leap year.
 * &lt;li&gt;day-of-year - There are 365 days in a standard ISO year and 366 in a leap year.
 *  The days are numbered from 1 to 365 or 1 to 366.
 * &lt;li&gt;leap-year - Leap years occur every 4 years, except where the year is divisble by 100 and not divisble by 400.
 * &lt;/ul&gt;
 *
 * @implSpec
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.

     * &lt;ul&gt;
     * &lt;li&gt;{@code EPOCH_DAY} - If present, this is converted to a {@code LocalDate}
     *  and all other date fields are then cross-checked against the date.
     * &lt;li&gt;{@code PROLEPTIC_MONTH} - If present, then it is split into the
     *  {@code YEAR} and {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR}. If the mode is strict or smart
     *  then the field is validated.
     * &lt;li&gt;{@code YEAR_OF_ERA} and {@code ERA} - If both are present, then they
     *  are combined to form a {@code YEAR}. In lenient mode, the {@code YEAR_OF_ERA}
     *  range is not validated, in smart and strict mode it is. The {@code ERA} is
     *  validated for range in all three modes. If only the {@code YEAR_OF_ERA} is
     *  present, and the mode is smart or lenient, then the current era (CE/AD)
     *  is assumed. In strict mode, no era is assumed and the {@code YEAR_OF_ERA} is
     *  left untouched. If only the {@code ERA} is present, then it is left untouched.
     * &lt;li&gt;{@code YEAR}, {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR} and {@code DAY_OF_MONTH} -
     *  If all three are present, then they are combined to form a {@code LocalDate}.
     *  In all three modes, the {@code YEAR} is validated. If the mode is smart or strict,

     *  creating a date on the first of January in the requested year, then adding
     *  the difference in months, then the difference in days.
     *  If the mode is smart, and the day-of-month is greater than the maximum for
     *  the year-month, then the day-of-month is adjusted to the last day-of-month.
     *  If the mode is strict, then the three fields must form a valid date.
     * &lt;li&gt;{@code YEAR} and {@code DAY_OF_YEAR} -
     *  If both are present, then they are combined to form a {@code LocalDate}.
     *  In all three modes, the {@code YEAR} is validated.
     *  If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to

     * &lt;li&gt;{@code YEAR}, {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR}, {@code ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH} and
     *  {@code ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH} -
     *  If all four are present, then they are combined to form a {@code LocalDate}.
     *  In all three modes, the {@code YEAR} is validated.
     *  If the mode is lenient, then the date is combined in a manner equivalent to
     *  creating a date on the first of January in the requested year, then adding
     *  the difference in months, then the difference in weeks, then in days.
     *  If the mode is smart or strict, then the all four fields are validated to
     *  their outer ranges. The date is then combined in a manner equivalent to
     *  creating a date on the first day of the requested year and month, then adding
     *  the amount in weeks and days to reach their values. If the mode is strict,
     *  the date is additionally validated to check that the day and week adjustment
     *  did not change the month.
     * &lt;li&gt;{@code YEAR}, {@code MONTH_OF_YEAR}, {@code ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH} and
     *  {@code DAY_OF_WEEK} - If all four are present, then they are combined to
     *  form a {@code LocalDate}. The approach is the same as described above for
     *  years, months and weeks in {@code ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH}.
     *  The day-of-week is adjusted as the next or same matching day-of-week once
