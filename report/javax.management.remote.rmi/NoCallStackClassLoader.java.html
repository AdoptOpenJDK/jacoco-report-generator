/**
    &lt;p&gt;A class loader that only knows how to define a limited number
    of classes, and load a limited number of other classes through
    delegation to another loader.  It is used to get around a problem
    with Serialization, in particular as used by RMI (including
    RMI/IIOP).  The JMX Remote API defines exactly what class loader
    must be used to deserialize arguments on the server, and return
    values on the client.  We communicate this class loader to RMI by
    setting it as the context class loader.  RMI uses the context
    class loader to load classes as it deserializes, which is what we
    want.  However, before consulting the context class loader, it
    looks up the call stack for a class with a non-null class loader,
    and uses that if it finds one.  So, in the standalone version of
    javax.management.remote, if the class you're looking for is known
    to the loader of jmxremote.jar (typically the system class loader)
    then that loader will load it.  This contradicts the class-loading
    semantics required.

    &lt;p&gt;We get around the problem by ensuring that the search up the
    call stack will find a non-null class loader that doesn't load any
    classes of interest, namely this one.  So even though this loader
    is indeed consulted during deserialization, it never finds the
    class being deserialized.  RMI then proceeds to use the context
    class loader, as we require.

    &lt;p&gt;This loader is constructed with the name and byte-code of one
    or more classes that it defines, and a class-loader to which it
    will delegate certain other classes required by that byte-code.
    We construct the byte-code somewhat painstakingly, by compiling
    the Java code directly, converting into a string, copying that
    string into the class that needs this loader, and using the
    stringToBytes method to convert it into the byte array.  We
    compile with -g:none because there's not much point in having
    line-number information and the like in these directly-encoded
    classes.

    &lt;p&gt;The referencedClassNames should contain the names of all
    classes that are referenced by the classes defined by this loader.
    It is not necessary to include standard J2SE classes, however.
    Here, a class is referenced if it is the superclass or a
    superinterface of a defined class, or if it is the type of a
    field, parameter, or return value.  A class is not referenced if
    it only appears in the throws clause of a method or constructor.
    Of course, referencedClassNames should not contain any classes
    that the user might want to deserialize, because the whole point
    of this loader is that it does not find such classes.
