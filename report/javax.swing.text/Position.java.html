/**
 * Represents a location within a document.  It is intended to abstract away
 * implementation details of the document and enable specification of
 * positions within the document that are capable of tracking of change as
 * the document is edited.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A {@code Position} object points at a location between two characters.
 * As the surrounding content is altered, the {@code Position} object
 * adjusts its offset automatically to reflect the changes. If content is
 * inserted or removed before the {@code Position} object's location, then the
 * {@code Position} increments or decrements its offset, respectively,
 * so as to point to the same location. If a portion of the document is removed
 * that contains a {@code Position}'s offset, then the {@code Position}'s
 * offset becomes that of the beginning of the removed region. For example, if
 * a {@code Position} has an offset of 5 and the region 2-10 is removed, then
 * the {@code Position}'s offset becomes 2.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * {@code Position} with an offset of 0 is a special case. It never changes its
 * offset while document content is altered.
