/**
 * An Action implementation useful for key bindings that are
 * shared across a number of different text components.  Because
 * the action is shared, it must have a way of getting it's
 * target to act upon.  This class provides support to try and
 * find a text component to operate on.  The preferred way of
 * getting the component to act upon is through the ActionEvent
 * that is received.  If the Object returned by getSource can
 * be narrowed to a text component, it will be used.  If the
 * action event is null or can't be narrowed, the last focused
 * text component is tried.  This is determined by being
 * used in conjunction with a JTextController which
 * arranges to share that information with a TextAction.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt;
 * Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
 * future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
 * appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
 * the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage
 * of all JavaBeans&amp;trade;
 * has been added to the &lt;code&gt;java.beans&lt;/code&gt; package.
 * Please see {@link java.beans.XMLEncoder}.
