/**
 * A {@link MethodVisitor} adapter to sort the exception handlers. The handlers
 * are sorted in a method innermost-to-outermost. This allows the programmer to
 * add handlers without worrying about ordering them correctly with respect to
 * existing, in-code handlers.
 *
 * Behavior is only defined for properly-nested handlers. If any &quot;try&quot; blocks
 * overlap (something that isn't possible in Java code) then this may not do
 * what you want. In fact, this adapter just sorts by the length of the &quot;try&quot;
 * block, taking advantage of the fact that a given try block must be larger
 * than any block it contains).
