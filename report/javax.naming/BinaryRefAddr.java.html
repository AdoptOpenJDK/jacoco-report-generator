/**
  * This class represents the binary form of the address of
  * a communications end-point.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * A BinaryRefAddr consists of a type that describes the communication mechanism
  * and an opaque buffer containing the address description
  * specific to that communication mechanism. The format and interpretation of
  * the address type and the contents of the opaque buffer are based on
  * the agreement of three parties: the client that uses the address,
  * the object/server that can be reached using the address,
  * and the administrator or program that creates the address.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * An example of a binary reference address is an BER X.500 presentation address.
  * Another example of a binary reference address is a serialized form of
  * a service's object handle.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * A binary reference address is immutable in the sense that its fields
  * once created, cannot be replaced. However, it is possible to access
  * the byte array used to hold the opaque buffer. Programs are strongly
  * recommended against changing this byte array. Changes to this
  * byte array need to be explicitly synchronized.
