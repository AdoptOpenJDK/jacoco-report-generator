  * This exception is thrown to indicate that the operation reached
  * a point in the name where the operation cannot proceed any further.
  * When performing an operation on a composite name, a naming service
  * provider may reach a part of the name that does not belong to its
  * namespace.  At that point, it can construct a
  * CannotProceedException and then invoke methods provided by
  * javax.naming.spi.NamingManager (such as getContinuationContext())
  * to locate another provider to continue the operation.  If this is
  * not possible, this exception is raised to the caller of the
  * context operation.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * If the program wants to handle this exception in particular, it
  * should catch CannotProceedException explicitly before attempting to
  * catch NamingException.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * A CannotProceedException instance is not synchronized against concurrent
  * multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify
  * CannotProceedException should lock the object.
