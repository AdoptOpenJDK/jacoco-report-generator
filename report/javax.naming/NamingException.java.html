  * The nature of the failure is described by the name of the subclass.
  * This exception captures the information pinpointing where the operation
  * failed, such as where resolution last proceeded to.
  * &lt;ul&gt;
  * &lt;li&gt; Resolved Name. Portion of name that has been resolved.
  * &lt;li&gt; Resolved Object. Object to which resolution of name proceeded.
  * &lt;li&gt; Remaining Name. Portion of name that has not been resolved.
  * &lt;li&gt; Explanation. Detail explaining why name resolution failed.
  * &lt;li&gt; Root Exception. The exception that caused this naming exception
  *                     to be thrown.
  *&lt;/ul&gt;
  * null is an acceptable value for any of these fields. When null,
  * it means that no such information has been recorded for that field.

  * A NamingException instance is not synchronized against concurrent
  * multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify
  * a single NamingException instance should lock the object.

  * This exception has been retrofitted to conform to
  * the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism.  The
  * &lt;i&gt;root exception&lt;/i&gt; (or &lt;i&gt;root cause&lt;/i&gt;) is the same object as the
