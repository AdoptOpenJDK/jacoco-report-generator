/**
  * This class represents the address of a communications end-point.
  * It consists of a type that describes the communication mechanism
  * and an address contents determined by an RefAddr subclass.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * For example, an address type could be &quot;BSD Printer Address&quot;,
  * which specifies that it is an address to be used with the BSD printing
  * protocol. Its contents could be the machine name identifying the
  * location of the printer server that understands this protocol.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * A RefAddr is contained within a Reference.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * RefAddr is an abstract class. Concrete implementations of it
  * determine its synchronization properties.
