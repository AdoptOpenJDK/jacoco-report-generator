/**
  * This class represents a reference to an object that is found outside of
  * the naming/directory system.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * Reference provides a way of recording address information about
  * objects which themselves are not directly bound to the naming/directory system.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * A Reference consists of an ordered list of addresses and class information
  * about the object being referenced.
  * Each address in the list identifies a communications endpoint
  * for the same conceptual object.  The &quot;communications endpoint&quot;
  * is information that indicates how to contact the object. It could
  * be, for example, a network address, a location in memory on the
  * local machine, another process on the same machine, etc.
  * The order of the addresses in the list may be of significance
  * to object factories that interpret the reference.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * Multiple addresses may arise for
  * various reasons, such as replication or the object offering interfaces
  * over more than one communication mechanism.  The addresses are indexed
  * starting with zero.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * A Reference also contains information to assist in creating an instance
  * of the object to which this Reference refers.  It contains the class name
  * of that object, and the class name and location of the factory to be used
  * to create the object.
  * The class factory location is a space-separated list of URLs representing
  * the class path used to load the factory.  When the factory class (or
  * any class or resource upon which it depends) needs to be loaded,
  * each URL is used (in order) to attempt to load the class.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * A Reference instance is not synchronized against concurrent access by multiple
  * threads. Threads that need to access a single Reference concurrently should
  * synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking.
