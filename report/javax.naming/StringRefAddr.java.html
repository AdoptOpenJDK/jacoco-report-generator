/**
 * This class represents the string form of the address of
 * a communications end-point.
 * It consists of a type that describes the communication mechanism
 * and a string contents specific to that communication mechanism.
 * The format and interpretation of
 * the address type and the contents of the address are based on
 * the agreement of three parties: the client that uses the address,
 * the object/server that can be reached using the address, and the
 * administrator or program that creates the address.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; An example of a string reference address is a host name.
 * Another example of a string reference address is a URL.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt; A string reference address is immutable:
 * once created, it cannot be changed.  Multithreaded access to
 * a single StringRefAddr need not be synchronized.
