  * This exception is thrown when a naming operation proceeds to a point
  * where a context is required to continue the operation, but the
  * resolved object is not a context. For example, Context.destroy() requires
  * that the named object be a context. If it is not, NotContextException
  * is thrown. Another example is a non-context being encountered during
  * the resolution phase of the Context methods.
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * It is also thrown when a particular subtype of context is required,
  * such as a DirContext, and the resolved object is a context but not of
  * the required subtype.
  * &lt;p&gt;
  * Synchronization and serialization issues that apply to NamingException
  * apply directly here.
