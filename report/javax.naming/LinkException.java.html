 * This exception is used to describe problems encounter while resolving links.

 * Analogous to how NamingException captures name resolution information,
 * LinkException captures &quot;link&quot;-name resolution information pinpointing
 * the problem encountered while resolving a link. All these fields may
 * be null.
 * &lt;ul&gt;
 * &lt;li&gt; Link Resolved Name. Portion of link name that has been resolved.
 * &lt;li&gt; Link Resolved Object. Object to which resolution of link name proceeded.
 * &lt;li&gt; Link Remaining Name. Portion of link name that has not been resolved.
 * &lt;li&gt; Link Explanation. Detail explaining why link resolution failed.
 *&lt;/ul&gt;
 *
  *&lt;p&gt;
  * A LinkException instance is not synchronized against concurrent
  * multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify
  * a single LinkException instance should lock the object.
