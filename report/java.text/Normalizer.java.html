/**
 * This class provides the method &lt;code&gt;normalize&lt;/code&gt; which transforms Unicode
 * text into an equivalent composed or decomposed form, allowing for easier
 * sorting and searching of text.
 * The &lt;code&gt;normalize&lt;/code&gt; method supports the standard normalization forms
 * described in
 * &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/tr15-23.html&quot;&gt;
 * Unicode Standard Annex #15 &amp;mdash; Unicode Normalization Forms&lt;/a&gt;.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Characters with accents or other adornments can be encoded in
 * several different ways in Unicode.  For example, take the character A-acute.
 * In Unicode, this can be encoded as a single character (the &quot;composed&quot; form):
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *      U+00C1    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * or as two separate characters (the &quot;decomposed&quot; form):
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *      U+0041    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
 *      U+0301    COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * To a user of your program, however, both of these sequences should be
 * treated as the same &quot;user-level&quot; character &quot;A with acute accent&quot;.  When you
 * are searching or comparing text, you must ensure that these two sequences are
 * treated as equivalent.  In addition, you must handle characters with more than
 * one accent. Sometimes the order of a character's combining accents is
 * significant, while in other cases accent sequences in different orders are
 * really equivalent.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Similarly, the string &quot;ffi&quot; can be encoded as three separate letters:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *      U+0066    LATIN SMALL LETTER F
 *      U+0066    LATIN SMALL LETTER F
 *      U+0069    LATIN SMALL LETTER I&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * or as the single character
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *      U+FB03    LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FFI&lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * The ffi ligature is not a distinct semantic character, and strictly speaking
 * it shouldn't be in Unicode at all, but it was included for compatibility
 * with existing character sets that already provided it.  The Unicode standard
 * identifies such characters by giving them &quot;compatibility&quot; decompositions
 * into the corresponding semantic characters.  When sorting and searching, you
 * will often want to use these mappings.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The &lt;code&gt;normalize&lt;/code&gt; method helps solve these problems by transforming
 * text into the canonical composed and decomposed forms as shown in the first
 * example above. In addition, you can have it perform compatibility
 * decompositions so that you can treat compatibility characters the same as
 * their equivalents.
 * Finally, the &lt;code&gt;normalize&lt;/code&gt; method rearranges accents into the
 * proper canonical order, so that you do not have to worry about accent
 * rearrangement on your own.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The W3C generally recommends to exchange texts in NFC.
 * Note also that most legacy character encodings use only precomposed forms and
 * often do not encode any combining marks by themselves. For conversion to such
 * character encodings the Unicode text needs to be normalized to NFC.
 * For more usage examples, see the Unicode Standard Annex.
