/**
 * Parameters used as input for the PKIX {@code CertPathBuilder}
 * algorithm.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * A PKIX {@code CertPathBuilder} uses these parameters to {@link
 * CertPathBuilder#build build} a {@code CertPath} which has been
 * validated according to the PKIX certification path validation algorithm.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;To instantiate a {@code PKIXBuilderParameters} object, an
 * application must specify one or more &lt;i&gt;most-trusted CAs&lt;/i&gt; as defined by
 * the PKIX certification path validation algorithm. The most-trusted CA
 * can be specified using one of two constructors. An application
 * can call {@link #PKIXBuilderParameters(Set, CertSelector)
 * PKIXBuilderParameters(Set, CertSelector)}, specifying a
 * {@code Set} of {@code TrustAnchor} objects, each of which
 * identifies a most-trusted CA. Alternatively, an application can call
 * {@link #PKIXBuilderParameters(KeyStore, CertSelector)
 * PKIXBuilderParameters(KeyStore, CertSelector)}, specifying a
 * {@code KeyStore} instance containing trusted certificate entries, each
 * of which will be considered as a most-trusted CA.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;In addition, an application must specify constraints on the target
 * certificate that the {@code CertPathBuilder} will attempt
 * to build a path to. The constraints are specified as a
 * {@code CertSelector} object. These constraints should provide the
 * {@code CertPathBuilder} with enough search criteria to find the target
 * certificate. Minimal criteria for an {@code X509Certificate} usually
 * include the subject name and/or one or more subject alternative names.
 * If enough criteria is not specified, the {@code CertPathBuilder}
 * may throw a {@code CertPathBuilderException}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;b&gt;Concurrent Access&lt;/b&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not
 * thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single
 * object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
 * provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
 * separate objects need not synchronize.
