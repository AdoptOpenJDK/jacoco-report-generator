/**
 * The HttpReceiveSocket class extends the WrappedSocket class
 * by removing the HTTP protocol packaging from the input stream and
 * formatting the output stream as an HTTP response.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * The output stream must be explicitly closed for the output to be
 * sent, since the HttpResponseOutputStream needs to buffer the entire
 * transmission to be able to fill in the content-length field of
 * the HTTP header.  Closing this socket will do this.
 *
 * The constructor blocks until the HTTP protocol header
 * is received.  This could be fixed, but I don't think it should be a
 * problem because this object would not be created unless the
 * HttpAwareServerSocket has detected the beginning of the header
 * anyway, so the rest should be there.
 *
 * This socket can only be used to process one POST and reply to it.
 * Another message would be received on a newly accepted socket anyway.
